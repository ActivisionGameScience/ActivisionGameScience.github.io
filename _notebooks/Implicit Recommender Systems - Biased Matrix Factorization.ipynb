    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation engines are becoming ubiquitous in the modern consumer landscape. From Netflix's personalized movie recommendations to Amazon's raft of suggested items (New For Your, Recommendations for You in the Kindle Store, etc...), to Spotify's wildly popular personalized Discover Weekly Playlist, recommendation engines have become an essential tool for promoting content discovery and extending consumer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a proliferation of algorithms in the data science community upon which recommender systems are built, but they all follow the basic central dogma that similar users like similar items. The hard part, of course, is deciding exactly what \"similar\" means and how to measure it. For Netflix, similar users are users who rate movies similarly. For Spotify, similar users are users who listen to the same kinds of music (a little thought will convince you that these two ideas, while similar, are not really the same). \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest type of recommender system, called a *collaborative filter*, is essentially a literal interpretation of \"similar users like similar things\" [Goldberg1992](#Goldberg1992). Once a metric for similarity is decided on, one just looks at the top rated items of the $k$ nearest neighbors (with respect to the similarity metric), filters out those items which the user of interest has already seen/consumed, and *voila*:  personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filters have the advantages of being relatively easy to implement and relatively easy to interpret (e.g. we recommended movie A to user 1 because users 2, 3, and 4 all rated it highly and have similar ratings profiles to user 1). This being the Age of Data Science, though, it is no longer enough to have a reasonable explanation. We can actually measure how effectively a recommender system predicts the ratings of users on unseen items. Thus began Netflix's famous quest for better recommender systems, leading to the famous [million dollar prize](http://www.netflixprize.com/) and [eventual solution](http://www.netflixprize.com/community/viewtopic.php?id=1537) [Bell2008](#Bell2008) (by a team of experts working for several years).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the recommender system that won the Netflix prize was never put into production (it was a carefully tuned mix of many statistical models, and the marginal gain obtained by implementing all of the models was not worth the technical price compared to simply implementing a few of the best ones), the data science community, and the wider commercial world, learned without a doubt that, while collaborative filters are explainable and easily implementable, one can do significantly better if one is willing to flex a bit of mathematical muscle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were essentially two types of recommender systems in the final solution to the Netflix prize, and they have become the bread and butter of the current state of the art: matrix factorization models and restricted Bolzmann machines (RBMs). We will discuss matrix factorization models in this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be interested in two refinements of the basic matrix factorization model for recommendations: using implicit feedback, and using user and item biases. "

    "## Implicit Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of recommender systems in the wider commercial world is that one rarely has explicit ratings data (Netflix strongly encourages users to rate movies and leverage the tech built around those ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, user-item interactions like clicks, purchases, song listens (or fast-forwards), etc, are used as a proxy to indicate a preference or distaste for a particular item (possibly very weakly). If a user listens to a song only once, maybe it indicates that they didn't like the song.  However, maybe they were busy or weren't paying attention and actually would like to hear the song again. If a user listens to a song 100 times, it is a safe bet that they like the song. But it is hard to draw a line between unknown preference and known preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of indirect information about user-item preferences is known as *implicit feedback*, and many smart people have thought long and hard about how to deal with it. We won't delve much into the modeling of implicit feedback in today's post.  It turns out to be relatively effective to model a user's preference on a scale of 0 (bad) to 1 (good) instead of modeling the user's raw number of interactions (or whatever number is actually being measured). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the number of user-item interations (song listens, for example) as a measure of our confidence in our model's prediction for the user's preference of the item.\n",

    "- There are other methods for minimizing such a convex cost function, for example, gradient descent (or stochastic gradient descent, or batch SGD, etc...). One important difference here is that at each step of our algorithm, we find the *exact* minimum; we don't take small steps in a downward direction. So if we do step 1), a second application of step 1) will have no effect: we're already at the absolute minimum of $C$ with $Y$ held fixed. It also means that a single iteration of the above algorithm generally moves much further than an iteration of a gradient descent algorithm; i.e. we need fewer iterations for convergence.\n",

    "It turns out that the matrix multiplication $X^TC^iX$ and the matrix-vector product $X^Td_i$ are both easier to implement in `numpy` than to express in standard linear algebra notation. A direct implementation of the algorithm is of course possible, but a small bit of thought improves performance vastly.\n",

    "A direct implementation of the matrix product $X^TC^iX$ would be something like\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ci = np.diag(c[i])\n",
    "    XTCiX = np.dot(X, np.dot(Ci, np.dot(X.T)).\n",
    "    \n",
    "But the matrix product `np.dot(X, Ci)` is just multiplying the rows of $X$, in order, by the diagonal elements of $C^i$, which is achieved very efficiently by simple `numpy` broadcasting. So we can achieve the same matrix product via\n",
    "\n",
    "    XTCiX = np.dot(c[i] * X.T, X).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Moreover, since $d_i = p_i + \\alpha r_i$ (which follows from $p_{ui} r_{ui} = r_{ui}$), we can rewrite the algorithm in terms of just the scaled raw counts $\\alpha R$ and the preference $p$ as\n",

    "Hence, we can completely avoid constructing the diagonal matrices $C^i$ and $C^u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when `n_users` and `n_items` are large, $R$ (and hence $p$) will generally be sparse matrices. The matrix $\\left(X^TX+\\lambda I + \\alpha X^TR^iX\\right)$ is, however, $N\\times N$ and since the number of factors is generally small (on the order of 10), there is no great savings by using a sparse implementation of this matrix. On the other hand, only the user vectors corresponding to nonzero entries of $r_i$ (and $p_i$) are needed in the computation of $X^TR^iX$ and of $X^T(p_i + \\alpha r_i)$, so if the algorithm is parallelized, it is *very* useful to only ship those vectors to the workers doing the computation for $y_i$ (this is, for example, how the [Spark implementation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html) works). Our implementation is not parallelized (for the sake of clarity), so we don't need to worry about shipping data to workers."
