    "The members of the Analytics Services team here at Activision are heavy users of [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) and [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) to deploy and manage services on our clusters. We are also huge fans of Python and the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter project was recently reorganized from IPython, in a move referred to as \"the split\": One part that was originally part of IPython (`IPython.parallel`) was split off into a separate project [ipyparallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel). This powerful component of the IPython ecosystem is generally overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I will give a quick introduction to the ipyparallel project and then introduce a new launcher we have open sourced to deploy IPython clusters into Mesos clusters. While we have published this notebook in HTML, please feel free to download the [original](https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ActivisionGameScience.github.io/blob/master/_notebooks/IPython%20Parallel%20Introduction.ipynb) to follow along.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ipyparallel project is the new home of IPython.parallel module that was hosted within IPython core before 2015. The focus of the project is interactive cluster computing. This focus on interactive computing and first-class integration with the IPython project is a distinguishing feature. For a more complete dive into the internals of ipyparallel, please visit the [docs](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html). I aim to give the bare minimum to get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most basic level an IPython cluster is a set of Python interpreters that can be accessed over TCP. Under the hood, it works similarly to how Jupyter/IPython work today. When you open a new notebook in the browser, a Python process (called a kernel) will be started to run the code you submit. ipyparallel does the same thing except instead of a single Python kernel, you can start many distributed kernels over many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main components to the stack. \n",
    "- Client: A Python process which submits work. Usually this is an IPython session or a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "- Controller: The central coordinator which accepts work from the client and passes it to engines, collects results and sends back to the client.\n",
    "- Engine: A Python interpreter that communicates with the controller to accept work and submit results. Roughly equivalent to an IPython kernel. \n",

A better approach is to assign work to each engine as it finishes. This way the work will be load balanced over the cluster and you will complete your process earlier. ipyparallel provides the `LoadBalancedView` for this exact use case. For this specific problem, threading or an async event loop would likely be a better approach to speeding up or scaling out, but suspend your disbelief for this exercise."

    "\n",
    "ipyparallel provides support for a range of cluster and batch job management systems such as PBS and WindowsHPC. The full list is provided in the documentation. ipyparallel also provides an SSH based launcher. Given passwordless ssh onto machine you can easily deploy engines and connect them to your controller and client. Also there is a wonderful project [starcluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/plugins/ipython.html) that helps spin up machines from cloud providers. \n",

    "However, we are big users of Mesos, Docker, and Marathon to manage our clusters and services. Furthermore, even with the existing launchers, managing complex dependencies within the engines is a pain. Using Docker to package all dependencies makes deploying heterogeneous clusters easier. Targeting our existing cluster management system and simplifying dependencies is a big win for us.\n",

    "With this in mind, we are open sourcing a new ipyparallel launcher that deploys IPython clusters into Mesos using Docker and Marathon. The code lives [here](https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ipyparallel-mesos/) and on pypi/conda as `ipyparallel_mesos`.\n",

    "We have two pre-built Docker images for the [Controller](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdennison/ipyparallel-marathon-controller/) and [Engine](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdennison/ipyparallel-marathon-engine/). These are stripped down Docker images. Internally we use conda for almost all our dependencies, even inside our Docker containers. Please visit our public [conda recipes](https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes) and [channel](https://anaconda.org/ActivisionGameScience). However, extending from the `ipyparallel-marathon-engine` image will allow you to easily install your custom dependencies with or without conda.\n",
