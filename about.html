 Activision Game Science is based in two awesome places: Santa Monica, CA (the Mothership) and Boulder, CO (God's Country). We develop statistical tools and services to integrate into our games and their operations. Examples include anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and computer vision. We work at the interface of design, big data engineering, and math to help deliver epic entertainment experiences.
